            <h2>What I do these days 2025-05-08</h2>
            <p>
                We live in strange times. When I say that, I mean it politically, but I won't get into that here.

                I've been looking for a job for about four months now. It’s been an eye-opening process, seeing how much the market has changed over the past five years.

                I’m proud of my new bachelor's degree in computer science and my LaTeX resume, by the way. No cutting corners here. 😄
                I’m not just figuring out how to get a job but also where I want to go from this point in my career.

                I love cybersecurity analysis, embedded systems, APIs, and building tools. I’m just too curious to settle on one thing to specialize in. One thing I know for sure, though, is that I deeply value open source.

                Open-source code can have a much larger impact. It can outlive you. It can outlive companies.

                My ideal job would be to wake up in the morning, have my smoothie, check GitHub issues, and spend the day proposing implementations and fixes.

                I’ve done some bug reporting for open-source projects in the past. That was my main form of contribution while working full-time and attending university, but recently, I started helping with translations for Mastodon. I’m focusing on Quebec French, though the system still confuses me a bit.

                I also started contributing to mitmproxy, an interesting tool with a lot of features. I chose it because it’s a relatively small project with good documentation, which made it a great first step into more hands-on contributions. It was also my first experience with PyO3, a Python library that lets you use Rust code in Python. It’s great for performance, but it comes with some challenges. The biggest one I’ve noticed is the mismatch in error handling between the two languages. I still prefer Python’s approach, but that might just be because I’m more familiar with it. It’s frustrating when an exception is raised, but instead of a full traceback, you just get a custom error message with no context.

                I have my eye on other projects, but for now, I’ll keep focusing on this one when I have free time.

                Wishing you all the best. Keep the lines of code flowing!

            <h2>Every programing languages I leaned so far that I can remember 2024-07-17</h2>
            <p>
                It started to code at 11. I was using C. The reason is that I wanted to understand how computrers works. 
                I found a web site to start. It was called "Le site du zero." 
                I realy liked this site and did some free courses in there. This website is now called open classroom.
                I was mostly just doing some text based RPG games. A bunch of if basicaly.
                The second language I can think of was mindstorms by lego. 
                I don't know if it was called like that back then. 
                We used it at high school with a little robot.
                I didn't program for some years after that. 
                I was learning electronic repair in a DEP or profecional study diploma I think it's called in English.
                In that course, I don't remember why but there was a part where we needed to flash PIC microcontrolers.
                I looked at the ASM code by curiousity and without doing anything with it I took the time to understand it.
                During that time I started to be fully on linux so I learned some bash automatiastions that will be reenforced later.
                I worked for a year selling computers. I kinda became the linux expert there. 
                I when to college in electronic computers and network and there, I learned a bunch of differant languages. 
                There was of course C++ on ATMEL microcontrolers and on x86. There was ladder and graphset for automats from Siemens. Old ones. 
                I remember the graphset having a canvas size limitation that made no sense to me.
                I learned there the HTML/CSS/javascript/PHP stack.
                I also had a project using the IOs of a raspberry pie with python. 
                That wasn't in the schools plan but I asked to use something else then C++ cause it was getting old for me.
                I asked the teacher if I could use something else to learn more and he said something like "Yeah. But I won't help."
                
                I will continue that later. I didn't realise how big that would be. :3

            <h2>Video game project 2024-07-05</h2>
            <p>
                I'm looking to start a video game project with one of my friend. 
                I did play with Unity a lot but now I will probably use Godot or maybe pygame or love I'm not sure yet. 
                It depends on what we will come up with. We will start the brainstorms in a month.

            <h2>out of grave (OOG) language project 2024-07-05</h2>
            <p>
                During a university course about developing a programming language, I made my own. I called it out of grave. 
                It's a dedicated (not general) language to make text-based games. I'm still working on it to make it more complete.
                The idea is to make a game that runs like a state machine. So you have one file (OOGE) to describe events and one file (OOG) to connect them.
                It compiles into a Java file, so it can be used by Java machines. It uses the combo SABLECC and object macro. Check it out: <a href="https://github.com/turboOrange/oog">OOG</a>

            <h2>My education is a bunch of detours 2024-07-05</h2>
            <p>
                I come from a tourist town up north. The economy there is centered around tourism. 
                I think it influenced a lot of my perspective on myself at the time.
                I wasn't great at high school, but let's just say I was in a stressful environment.
                I was already doing some C coding since I was around 11 for fun. I was mostly doing simple text adventures.
                I learned everything from a site that is now called Open Classroom but was at the time "le site du zero.".
                So when my science teacher finally made us program one of those Lego robots, I had so much fun. 
                He was trying to slow me down, saying that I had to learn the basics to do other things. 
                I told him I was already familiar tho so I guess he just didn't expect someone that young to have touched programming. 
                I know kids today are exposed to concepts at a young age, but back then, I was really young for that kind of stuff. When I finished high school, I wanted to live in Laval.

                I had to decide what I wanted to do with my life, and since I was already mentally preparing for a cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic scenario, I chose to take a two-year course in electronic repair.
                
                I’m serious. When I made that decision, I thought, “What would be one of the most important skills to have in that scenario?” Looking back, I’m not sure if it was naive or brilliant.
                
                From there, I learned the fundamentals of electronics. It was a really fun experience. After that, I spent a year selling computer parts at an electronics store.
                
                I realized there wasn’t much work in electronic repair because things are harder to fix by design. My curiosity got the better of me, so I went to college, even though I initially thought it was impossible for me.
                
                I did a four-year DEC in electronic computers and networks. It was such a great time. It combined my love for electronics with programming. It was the first time I programmed something relatively big. Everything was in C++ and close to the hardware.
                
                We worked with Atmel chips, CPLDs, Cisco network setups, logic gates, and cool electronic projects. It was pure fun. We even refurbished computers with Linux for students who couldn’t afford to buy them.
                
                After that, I decided to go for a degree in electrical engineering at university. I liked what I learned, but I didn’t finish it. I spent 1.5 years there. Unsure of what to do next, I took a year off from education and worked as a programmer.
                
                I decided to keep my job and switched to studying computer science at university. My favorite courses have been in cybersecurity, user interface architecture, and creating your own language.
                
                So here I am, with three courses left until I get my diploma and already five years of experience. I can’t wait. If you ask me what I want to specialize in now, I’m not sure.
                
                For now, I see cybersecurity as a hobby. I’m really into becoming a UX expert and ensuring interfaces are as functional as possible. I also love embedded systems. We’ll see what the future brings!

            <h2>My education is a bunch of detours. 2024-07-05</h2>
            <p>
                I come from a tourist town up north. The economy there is centered around tourism. 
                I think it influenced a lot of my perspective on myself at the time.
                I wasn't great at high school, but let's just say I was in a stressful environment.
                I was already doing some C-coding since I was around 11 for fun. I was mostly doing simple text adventures.
                I learned everything from a site that is now called Open Classroom but was at the time "le site du zero.".
                So when my science teacher finally made us program one of those Lego robots, I had so much fun. 
                He was trying to slow me down, saying that I had to learn the basics to do other things. 
                I told him I was already familiar tho so I guess he just didn't expect someone that young to have touched programming. 
                I know some concepts are shown at yong ages nowadays, but at the time I was really yong for that.
                When I finished high school, I wanted to live in Laval. 
                I had to choose what I wanted to do with my life, and since I was already mentally preparing for a cyber punk post-apo scenario, I decided to take a two-year course about electronic repair.
                I'm actually serious here. When I made that decision, I taught, "What would be one of the most important skills to have in that scenario?" I don't know if it was naive or brilliant.
                So from there, I learned the fundamentals of electronics. It was a really fun experience. When that one was finished, I spent a year selling computer stuff at an electronic store.
                I realized that there was not really a lot of work in electronic repair because things are harder to repair by design. I also had a bit too much curiosity. So I went to college, despite thinking it was impossible for me at first.
                It was a 4-year DEC in electronic computers and networks. It was such a good time. It was mixing what I loved about electronics and bringing me back to programming. It was the first time I programmed something relatively big. Everything was C++ and really close to hardware most of the time.
                There were Atmel chips, graphsets, CPLDs, Cisco network equipment setups, logic gates, and cool electronic projects. It was just pure fun. We even refurbished computers with Linux installed for students who didn't have the money to buy computers.
                When I finished this one, I decided to go full-on electric engineering at University. I liked what I learned, but I didn't finish it. I passed 1.5 years. Not knowing what to do, I took a break for education again for a year, working as a programmer.
                I decided to keep the job I had and go into computer science at University instead. My favorite courses have been about cyber security, user interface architecture, and a course about how to create your own language.
                So here I am. I have 3 courses to do, and I will have my diploma soon with already 5 years of experience. I can't wait for that. I have to say. If you ask me now what I would like to work on specifically, I don't know.
                For now, I see cyber security as a hobby. I'm really into becoming a UX expert and making sure interfaces are as functional as possible. I also have a love for embedded systems. We will see what the future brings, I guess.

Wow! You came to look at the source! There is no react or vue or angular here. It's just all handcrafted HTML. 
My! I have to give you something for checking out...
Here is something. It's a pic of me! You probably didn't expect it to be in the HTML right?

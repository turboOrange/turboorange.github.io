    <h2>new beginnings 2025-10-14</h2>
    <p>
        I finally find where I will spend most of my awake time for the next years: Damotech (❁´◡`❁)
        I will be in the QA side of things. Doing manual and automated testing on APIs and UIX (⌒‿⌒)
        While I will probably do a lot of functionality testing I'm hopping it's an opportunity for me to apply my cybersecurity and UX knowlege ( •̀ᴗ•́ )و ̑̑
        I'll do a lot of python again. Meanwhile, in my spare time I familiarise myself with other stacks (˘⌣˘)♡
        Since two of my most understood languages are starting to feel old (C, C++) I want to exlore new ones (rust, elisir, go) (๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵)و
        I'm also interrested in mobile development at the moment. I have a project idea that would be ideal for an elixir/react native stack. More on that later… (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)
        About Spinachlang, my quantum languagem, I started to add some rust in the compiler code. It will make it go faster for sure but it's also a preparation to make an LSP for it (•̀ᴗ•́)و
        The idea is that both the compiler and the LSP will be based on the same fast parser and AST builder. The LSP will be 100% rust and the compiler will keep it's python compiling code that uses pytket (⌐■_■)
        I use Spinach to also lean how to create interest around a project. At the moment, I seem to be failing at it. (≧▽≦)
        But it's a learning experience. I might release a video in a couple of week on you tube but I struggle with talking to a camera. It feels unnatural to me. A bit distopic even. (￣▽￣*)ゞ
        I'm happy about how things turns out even if the last months where difficult. I have a lot of hope for the future. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

    <h2>What's up! 2025-09-09</h2>
    <p>
          I worked on perfecting my setup. I now use neovim instead of VScode to force myself to learn modal edition. I now use zsh instead of bash to have that sweet autocompletion. I added copilot to neovim to see how it's integrated. It's not bad but it could be better. I tried Zed for fun!
          While I prefer vim for it's keyboard first, Zed looks really fun to use. I would like to use it in a company where everyone uses it. I generaly hate pair programing but with what Zed propose, it looks fun. The fact that you don't even have to leave the editor to interact with the team looks fun. It also have the best AI integration I ever saw.

          Since everything I use is terminal based now, I setted up a toy computer without graphics. I use it to code and do other things to see how far I can go witout wayland or x11. This text that you are reading right now is made with that computer. It feels like a return to the source. It's completely distraction free.

          I decided to look into ML developement too recently. I realised I have the knowlege required to understand everything but just never used a tool like pytorch. I might do a quick projet to help learn Cree or something. I'll see. On my way to Lady Gaga right now! Can't wait to see her live!

    <h2>I did a freaking language again. But this time I really REALLY like the results. 2025-08-21</h2>
    <p>
        So I created Spinach, a quantum language. Right now it can be translated to multiple other circuit representations that can be used directly on quantum computers.
        The idea is to create something more high-level representation. The code is shorter and more reusable. The two main advantages come from the ability to name things and the idea of pipelines.
        Spinach is somewhat inspired by functional programming. I don't think it deserves to be called functional. It just uses the pipelines like functions and everything turns around those pipelines.
        The pipelines are sequences of other pipelines or gates. In the end, they are sequences of gates.
        While doing some research about quantum computing I discovered that often, reversing a sequence of gates results in reversing their effects on a qubit and that property is used in some algorithms. So right now, I'm working on giving the ability to execute a pipeline in reverse.
        I would like to work eventually with researchers to see what they would like to see in my language and create a community around it. I just don't know how yet. The state of the project is a bit to pass from proof of concept to actual product.
        I want the tests and basic functionality to be solid before making it a community kind of project. I used Python with Lark. It's a great experience so far. The fact that it's Python makes it possibly compatible with Jupyter. Yes! I want the language to not only be its own thing but also be a Python library. A Python sublanguage for quantum.
        So someone will be able to use it to create a circuit that will be usable for simulation on Python. Isn't it fantastic! (Hakuna matata)

            <h2>My focus right now. 2025-07-14</h2>
            <p>
                So, I started to go hard on certifications 🎯. I'm on Coursera following multiple paths to get the set of certifications and experience I want for the future 🚀.
                I got some certifications for things I already knew just to put in my resume and get a refresher at the same time 🧠📜.
                I just think it looks more believable to the recruiter to see that [institution] says that [person] has [skill] than to see that [person] claims to have worked on [internal project] at [institution], even if the second gives more experience 💼✅.
                Personal projects on GitHub should be a big flag for what skills you have 💻, but I start to wonder if anyone really checks that 👀. I had one recruiter that seemed to be interested when I mentioned a project 🗣️.
                Here's the paths I follow on Coursera at the moment: Fullstack from IBM, DevOps from IBM, Public Speaking from University of Washington, Developing Mobile Apps with Flutter from IBM 📚🛠️.
                I basically focus on JavaScript and Python frameworks for employment 💻 but also get better at public speaking and Flutter for personal growth 🌱. I also learn Elixir for backends but there is no certification for now on that 🧪.
                I would like to learn Go, but I feel over time Elixir might be more worthy 🤔. Let's see how that statement ages ⏳. I'm working on a personal project right now with Dart for front end and Elixir for backend 🔄. I think it's an interesting mix 🧩.
                While I'm getting experience with finding a job, I take notes 📝. I think I will publish here a how-to once I crack it 💡. For now, it seems that getting certifications once in a while and engaging on LinkedIn attracts recruiters 📈.
                There are so many strange takes on LinkedIn, so it's easy to find ways to interact and look professional 👔. I mean, I found senior devs getting things wrong that they should know 😅.
                I think it's just that when you stay at the same job for long, you create mental models of things that are wrong but still work for what you do every day 🧠🔁.
                LinkedIn is not great. I mean, it's probably similar to other social networks, but I'm a Mastodon person that writes personal thoughts on a GitHub page 🐘📝. I'm used to good moderation, and I really don't appreciate hate speech and dumb debates 🚫🧠.
                I need my brain clear from all of this distraction 🧘‍♂️. Hope I will find my new job fast 🤞. I just miss working in a team right now 👥.
                Oh yeah!

                Random thought 💭. While I don't like JavaScript very much, I do like what they did with JSX 💡. I think we should avoid any kind of code as a string in code, and it really solves that situation 🔐. It extends HTML in JavaScript nicely 💻.
                You now need to put a client-side JavaScript code you want to embed in the HTML as a string 😕. It's a bit disappointing. It feels like the purpose was fulfilled at 99% 📉. It's discouraged anyway, but at the same time, what was the purpose of HTML5 if we are backing off from its major feature ❓
                I always found the idea of embedding JavaScript in HTML a bit disorganized 🧩. Even in this small, simple-looking website I separate CSS, HTML, and JavaScript like I think it should be 🧹.

                Anyway, have a good day ☀️. Have fun 🎉. It's hot outside 🌡️. I think I will go in a park relaxing or something 🌳🧺.

            <h2>UPDATE!!! 2025-06-16</h2>
            <p>
                Yop! Still looking for a job after 5 months! It sucks 😩 but I guess it's a good time to think about what I *really* want to do professionally.

                I mean, it's nice to have projects in all directions and I'm proud to be the silly guy who can design an electronic circuit, make an OK PCB that kinda looks like spaghetti 🍝, program a microcontroller, build a website, *and* attack one too 😈.

                But in the end, I have a bit too many δαίμων. I need a more narrow path. So I think I'll go with web development going forward. It intersects with a lot of things I like — UX, optimization, and cybersecurity. 🕸️🔐✨

                So I’ll focus more on projects that involve the web. I started a course from IBM about DevOps to sharpen my skills in this area. It's also an emerging field that still has a lot of things we haven’t quite figured out yet. It's exciting! 😄

                I also started two projects with more modern frameworks than what’s usually used in companies. Both use Elixir — one with LiveView, and the other with Flutter and Dart for the frontend. These stacks are exciting! ⚡

                I *could’ve* used Go instead, since I haven’t worked with it yet, but Elixir is far more interesting to me. I like the functional programming side of it. I really believe that backends — or anything stateless — are better built using functional paradigms. 🧠➡️🧠

                It’s also the language that can support *huge* amounts of traffic at the same time. That’s amazing! 😮 I also discovered that this blog could be RSS-powered. I’ll make that change eventually. I don’t know if anyone reads my posts 👀.

                I don’t want to integrate a tracker or anything here. Privacy is important to me. But if you want to let me know you've been here, you can contact me and just say, “I've been to your blog. Here's some money for you.” Or something like that. 💌💸

                I also completely flipped my development setup upside down. I’m no longer a VSCode person — I’m now a proud Neovim user! 💚 I also learned to use tmux, and even added a browser extension to work without a mouse. #fullkeyboardgang 🖥️⌨️

                I will soon have to get blue hair 💙.

                Also — happy Pride to everyone! 🏳️‍🌈 It’s *sort of* Pride in Montreal, but the real Pride is a bit later. I love that the Village is vibrant all summer, from international Pride to the Montreal one. 🌈💃🌆

            <p>
                🌈 For a Pride-related project (I wish I could render all that text in rainbow and still keep it readable 😅), I started a project for young people.
                That means—even though I’d love to use my favorite chip, make everything myself, and go all-out—I won’t. This project is made for kids to understand 👧🧒, so I’m going full Arduino Nano 🎛️ (still using FreeRTOS because I need it for this one ⚙️) to make a colorful electronic ocarina 🎶✨.
                I’ll design a custom board with KiCad 🛠️ so that the participants in the workshop can solder everything themselves 🔧 and keep it as a souvenir 💾.
                It’s the first time I’m doing something like this in such a short amount of time ⏱️. I’m excited! 😄🚀

            <h2>The perfect distro doesn't exist... yet... 2025-05-26</h2>
            <p>
                I put that here cause it's been a anoyance for me many times. Thing is, I use pop_os. Why? It works all the time. The versions you run of everything have been vetted by debian, ubuntu and pop_os. 
                They are old at this point but they are extremely stable. Other thing is, I do development. I just started a project with a programing language that's not alowed to drink yet. 
                Those languages and tools needs you to keep everything at latest stable to make anything work. It's not the first time that something like that happen but I will expain the instance that got me to start writing this.
                I started an Elixir project that uses Phoenix. My distro's Phoenix was more up to date then my distro's Elixir. In this case Phoenix didn't want to use that version of Elixir. What did I do? I when to check how people solve this online.
                In this case, the best way was to get the deb package online... I think... I don't actually remember. In those situations, you do things like adding a new repo to your list, you install from source, you go get a deb file online. 
                All of this takes time and can make the tool not update in the future or make you computer a bit more at risk.

                The problem is the lake of granularity. For me, for example, I want anything desktop and environment at a "recomended" or "tested" state. But any dev tools at a "latest stable" or maybe sometimes "unstable" state.
                I don't think I'm along. I think we need a distribution that would let us chose easyly. If I write `sudo apt install vim` give me the "recomended" version. But if I do `sudo apt install -x unstable vim` give me the unstable version.
                Give me the choice to go wild if I need to using the packaging system so I don't have to go somewhere else. And when it updates, you update acording to the choice. I write it in my blog like site here hoping someone will see it and be like OMG! XD

            <h2>AI is gambling for developers 2025-05-21</h2>
            <p>The thing with using AI to help you with code is that sometimes it gives you exactly what you would’ve written ✨, but other times the amount of modifying you need to do just isn’t worth it 🤯 — it’s faster to write it yourself ⌨️.

To see how efficient it can be, I tried multiple times to get the AI to do the thing 🤖, and I realized there’s a bit of a gambling aspect to it 🎰. You’re trying to go fast, so every minute spent interacting with the AI is a minute you’re betting ⏳💸. Sometimes you hit the jackpot 🎉, but a lot of the time you end up sinking more time into the machine 🕳️🕒.

I’m not convinced that AI truly optimizes my time ⏱️. I think you get more jackpots at the start of a project 🚀, but the more unique the project becomes, the more time you have to spend before getting your next one 🐢🎯.</p>

            <h2>Northsec 2025 2025-05-19</h2>
            <p>I figured I would log my experiences to better remember them myself but also to share with others.<br>
            Keep in mind that this is purely subjective.</p>

            <p>So, I went to the conferences and workshops at NorthSec 2025.<br>
            It was held at the Bonsecours Market in Old Montreal – a beautiful location.</p>

            <p>I arrived a bit early in the morning, so I took the opportunity to chat with some of the sponsors.<br>
            They had tables set up in the middle of the venue for networking and product demos.<br>
            Since I'm still job hunting, I made sure to visit some of them.<br>
            I met passionate people and discovered some interesting products.</p>

            <h3>Beginnings</h3>

            <h4>Badge</h4>
            <p>At 10:00, I finally got my badge.<br>
            This year, it was designed to gamify networking.<br>
            It featured an IR sensor and transmitter for "connecting" with others, earning both parties social points.<br>
            There was also a port at the bottom that looked like a DIMM slot, giving it a cartridge-like vibe.<br>
            This port was used to connect with the companies at the sponsor tables – you had to place the badge into a slot and play a kind of roulette game for reasons that weren't entirely clear.<br>
            I assume they chose this form factor for nostalgia, but who knows.<br>
            They gave us the badges with no explanation, so figuring out the features might be part of the game.<br>
            It's based on the ESP32, so it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.<br>
            As far as I know, the conference firmware wasn't using these, but I plan to flash the CTF firmware later for fun.</p>

            <h4>Foulab</h4>
            <p>While picking up the badge, I chatted with someone from Foulab – a makerspace in an old, abandoned-looking building in Montreal.<br>
            If you're curious, you can check them out at <a href="https://foulab.org">foulab.org</a>.<br>
            They had a Macintosh 128K or 512K (which I mistakenly called an Apple II) set up with a document open for people to add their emails to a mailing list.</p>

            <h4>Pickpocket</h4>
            <p>I also ran into someone showing off pickpocket skills as magic tricks.<br>
            He tried a routine I already knew on me, and I played dumb to see how good he was.<br>
            I didn't feel him working the strap of my watch, but I did notice a lot of pressure when he tried to undo it.<br>
            My G-Shock is pretty thick, so that might have made it harder for him.<br>
            Good execution overall, though.</p>

            <h4>Talks and Workshops</h4>

            <h3>Day One</h3>

            <h4>Nice to Meet You! That Will Be 20 Million Please</h4>
            <p>The first talk I attended was <em>Nice to Meet You! That Will Be 20 Million Please</em> by David Décary-Hétu.<br>
            It was about how to properly respond to ransomware attacks – essentially a good reminder to stay calm and avoid making rash decisions.</p>

            <h4>UNO Reverse Card: Exposing C2 Operators Through Their Own Logs</h4>
            <p>Next, I attended <em>UNO Reverse Card: Exposing C2 Operators Through Their Own Logs</em> by Estelle Ruellan.<br>
            She shared four stories about discovering details about malware operators by infecting them back and watching their activity.<br>
            It was interesting to see how these operators try to protect themselves and where they slip up.</p>

            <h4>Get Off Your High Horse: How Your Expertise Doesn't Matter in an IPV Context</h4>
            <p>I spent the rest of the day with Corinne Pulgar from lab2038 for <em>Get Off Your High Horse: How Your Expertise Doesn't Matter in an IPV Context</em>.<br>
            This was a workshop on managing cyber violence in intimate partner violence (IPV) situations.<br>
            We role-played realistic scenarios and attempted to virtually resolve problems based on real stories.<br>
            It was humbling – these situations are tricky, and general recommendations often don't work.<br>
            In short, there's no one-size-fits-all solution. Each situation is unique and must be handled case by case, with a focus on listening to the victims first.</p>

            <h4>Stolen Laptops - A Brief Overview of Modern Physical Access Attacks</h4>
            <p>I also attended <em>Stolen Laptops - A Brief Overview of Modern Physical Access Attacks</em> by Pierre-Nicolas Allard-Coutu.<br>
            This talk covered what can be done with a stolen laptop to access supposedly secure information and even gain access to new accounts.<br>
            It was a lot of firmware tampering and low-level hacking – a lot of fun to listen to.</p>

            <h3>Day Two</h3>

            <h4>Efficient Web Hacking with Caido</h4>
            <p>Originally, I planned to attend <em>Reading The Docs: Hardware Hacking</em> by Jonathan Marcil, but when I got there, the room was packed, and they were using an older badge.<br>
            Since I already know a bit about embedded systems, I decided it might be too beginner-level for me.<br>
            Instead, I went to <em>Efficient Web Hacking with Caido</em> by Justin Gardner.<br>
            Caido is a powerful web testing tool with a freemium model. The free version is quite powerful, and the premium is affordable.<br>
            The workshop covered features like request tampering, automation, and workflows, using a test website to practice.<br>
            It was really useful, and I plan to use Caido in future challenges.<br>
            Check it out if you're interested: <a href="https://caido.rhynorater.com">Caido</a>.</p>

            <h4>Enhancing Identity Credential Privacy with Zero-Knowledge Proofs</h4>
            <p>I also attended <em>Enhancing Identity Credential Privacy with Zero-Knowledge Proofs</em> by Christian Paquin.<br>
            This was essentially a presentation of Crescent, a new way to prove facts about yourself without revealing additional information.<br>
            For example, proving you're over 18 without revealing your actual birth date.<br>
            If you're curious, you can check out the GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/crescent-credentials">Crescent Credentials</a>.</p>

            <h4>How Not to Do ML: Showing the Negative Impact of Improper CVE Feature Selection in a Live Exploit Prediction Model</h4>
            <p>Finally, I went to <em>How Not to Do ML: Showing the Negative Impact of Improper CVE Feature Selection in a Live Exploit Prediction Model</em> by François Labrèche.<br>
            This talk was more of a personal journey through an ML project.<br>
            The main takeaway was that not all data is good data for an ML model – correlation does not imply causation, and models can easily be misled by poorly chosen features.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>So, that was my personal experience at NorthSec 2025.<br>
            It was a lot of fun, and I plan to go to Hackfest next. I'll probably do something similar for that as well.<br>
            I hope you enjoyed this entry and that it gave you a bit of insight into the event.<br>
            I'm still trying to start my YouTube channel, but I haven't quite found my voice yet.<br>
            I keep making videos and finding them too boring.<br>
            We'll see if I finally end up posting something.</p>

            <h2>Composition over inheritance 2025-05-14</h2>
            <p>
                So, I learned a bit more about Rust. I thought that traits were just an addition to the usual OOP model, but I was wrong.
                They actually replace inheritance entirely. In other words, there’s no way in Rust to make a class inherit from another.
                This is a pretty bold move, considering that inheritance is one of the four main principles of OOP.
                Composition seems superior on paper, though. I guess I’ll need to get more used to it to decide if it’s really a better approach.
                Maybe I’ll come back to it in a couple of years.

            <h2>What I do these days 2025-05-08</h2>
            <p>
                We live in strange times. When I say that, I mean it politically, but I won't get into that here.

                I've been looking for a job for about four months now. It’s been an eye-opening process, seeing how much the market has changed over the past five years.

                I’m proud of my new bachelor's degree in computer science and my LaTeX resume, by the way. No cutting corners here. 😄
                I’m not just figuring out how to get a job but also where I want to go from this point in my career.

                I love cybersecurity analysis, embedded systems, APIs, and building tools. I’m just too curious to settle on one thing to specialize in. One thing I know for sure, though, is that I deeply value open source.

                Open-source code can have a much larger impact. It can outlive you. It can outlive companies.

                My ideal job would be to wake up in the morning, have my smoothie, check GitHub issues, and spend the day proposing implementations and fixes.

                I’ve done some bug reporting for open-source projects in the past. That was my main form of contribution while working full-time and attending university, but recently, I started helping with translations for Mastodon. I’m focusing on Quebec French, though the system still confuses me a bit.

                I also started contributing to mitmproxy, an interesting tool with a lot of features. I chose it because it’s a relatively small project with good documentation, which made it a great first step into more hands-on contributions. It was also my first experience with PyO3, a Python library that lets you use Rust code in Python. It’s great for performance, but it comes with some challenges. The biggest one I’ve noticed is the mismatch in error handling between the two languages. I still prefer Python’s approach, but that might just be because I’m more familiar with it. It’s frustrating when an exception is raised, but instead of a full traceback, you just get a custom error message with no context.

                I have my eye on other projects, but for now, I’ll keep focusing on this one when I have free time.

                Wishing you all the best. Keep the lines of code flowing!

            <h2>Every programing languages I leaned so far that I can remember 2024-07-17</h2>
            <p>
                It started to code at 11. I was using C. The reason is that I wanted to understand how computrers works. 
                I found a web site to start. It was called "Le site du zero." 
                I realy liked this site and did some free courses in there. This website is now called open classroom.
                I was mostly just doing some text based RPG games. A bunch of if basicaly.
                The second language I can think of was mindstorms by lego. 
                I don't know if it was called like that back then. 
                We used it at high school with a little robot.
                I didn't program for some years after that. 
                I was learning electronic repair in a DEP or profecional study diploma I think it's called in English.
                In that course, I don't remember why but there was a part where we needed to flash PIC microcontrolers.
                I looked at the ASM code by curiousity and without doing anything with it I took the time to understand it.
                During that time I started to be fully on linux so I learned some bash automatiastions that will be reenforced later.
                I worked for a year selling computers. I kinda became the linux expert there. 
                I when to college in electronic computers and network and there, I learned a bunch of differant languages. 
                There was of course C++ on ATMEL microcontrolers and on x86. There was ladder and graphset for automats from Siemens. Old ones. 
                I remember the graphset having a canvas size limitation that made no sense to me.
                I learned there the HTML/CSS/javascript/PHP stack.
                I also had a project using the IOs of a raspberry pie with python. 
                That wasn't in the schools plan but I asked to use something else then C++ cause it was getting old for me.
                I asked the teacher if I could use something else to learn more and he said something like "Yeah. But I won't help."
                
                I will continue that later. I didn't realise how big that would be. :3

            <p>
                I'm looking to start a video game project with one of my friend. 
                I did play with Unity a lot but now I will probably use Godot or maybe pygame or love I'm not sure yet. 
                It depends on what we will come up with. We will start the brainstorms in a month.

            <h2>out of grave (OOG) language project 2024-07-05</h2>
            <p>
                During a university course about developing a programming language, I made my own. I called it out of grave. 
                It's a dedicated (not general) language to make text-based games. I'm still working on it to make it more complete.
                The idea is to make a game that runs like a state machine. So you have one file (OOGE) to describe events and one file (OOG) to connect them.
                It compiles into a Java file, so it can be used by Java machines. It uses the combo SABLECC and object macro. Check it out: <a href="https://github.com/turboOrange/oog">OOG</a>

            <h2>My education is a bunch of detours 2024-07-05</h2>
            <p>
                I come from a tourist town up north. The economy there is centered around tourism. 
                I think it influenced a lot of my perspective on myself at the time.
                I wasn't great at high school, but let's just say I was in a stressful environment.
                I was already doing some C coding since I was around 11 for fun. I was mostly doing simple text adventures.
                I learned everything from a site that is now called Open Classroom but was at the time "le site du zero.".
                So when my science teacher finally made us program one of those Lego robots, I had so much fun. 
                He was trying to slow me down, saying that I had to learn the basics to do other things. 
                I told him I was already familiar tho so I guess he just didn't expect someone that young to have touched programming. 
                I know kids today are exposed to concepts at a young age, but back then, I was really young for that kind of stuff. When I finished high school, I wanted to live in Laval.

                I had to decide what I wanted to do with my life, and since I was already mentally preparing for a cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic scenario, I chose to take a two-year course in electronic repair.
                
                I’m serious. When I made that decision, I thought, “What would be one of the most important skills to have in that scenario?” Looking back, I’m not sure if it was naive or brilliant.
                
                From there, I learned the fundamentals of electronics. It was a really fun experience. After that, I spent a year selling computer parts at an electronics store.
                
                I realized there wasn’t much work in electronic repair because things are harder to fix by design. My curiosity got the better of me, so I went to college, even though I initially thought it was impossible for me.
                
                I did a four-year DEC in electronic computers and networks. It was such a great time. It combined my love for electronics with programming. It was the first time I programmed something relatively big. Everything was in C++ and close to the hardware.
                
                We worked with Atmel chips, CPLDs, Cisco network setups, logic gates, and cool electronic projects. It was pure fun. We even refurbished computers with Linux for students who couldn’t afford to buy them.
                
                After that, I decided to go for a degree in electrical engineering at university. I liked what I learned, but I didn’t finish it. I spent 1.5 years there. Unsure of what to do next, I took a year off from education and worked as a programmer.
                
                I decided to keep my job and switched to studying computer science at university. My favorite courses have been in cybersecurity, user interface architecture, and creating your own language.
                
                So here I am, with three courses left until I get my diploma and already five years of experience. I can’t wait. If you ask me what I want to specialize in now, I’m not sure.
                
                For now, I see cybersecurity as a hobby. I’m really into becoming a UX expert and ensuring interfaces are as functional as possible. I also love embedded systems. We’ll see what the future brings!

            <h2>Northsec 2025 2025-05-14</h2>
            <p>
                <md-block>
                    I figured I would log my experiences to better remember them myself but also to share with others.
                    Keep in mind that this is purely subjective.

                    So, I went to the conferences and workshops at NorthSec 2025.
                    It was held at the Bonsecours Market in Old Montreal – a beautiful location.

                    I arrived a bit early in the morning, so I took the opportunity to chat with some of the sponsors.
                    They had tables set up in the middle of the venue for networking and product demos.
                    Since I'm still job hunting, I made sure to visit some of them.
                    I met passionate people and discovered some interesting products.

                    # Beginnings

                    ## Badge

                    At 10:00, I finally got my badge.
                    This year, it was designed to gamify networking.
                    It featured an IR sensor and transmitter for "connecting" with others, earning both parties social points.
                    There was also a port at the bottom that looked like a DIMM slot, giving it a cartridge-like vibe.
                    This port was used to connect with the companies at the sponsor tables – you had to place the badge into a slot and play a kind of roulette game for reasons that weren't entirely clear.
                    I assume they chose this form factor for nostalgia, but who knows.
                    They gave us the badges with no explanation, so figuring out the features might be part of the game.
                    It's based on the ESP32, so it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.
                    As far as I know, the conference firmware wasn't using these, but I plan to flash the CTF firmware later for fun.

                    ## Foulab

                    While picking up the badge, I chatted with someone from Foulab – a makerspace in an old, abandoned-looking building in Montreal.
                    If you're curious, you can check them out at [foulab.org](https://foulab.org).
                    They had a Macintosh 128K or 512K (which I mistakenly called an Apple II) set up with a document open for people to add their emails to a mailing list.

                    ## Pickpocket

                    I also ran into someone showing off pickpocket skills as magic tricks.
                    He tried a routine I already knew on me, and I played dumb to see how good he was.
                    I didn't feel him working the strap of my watch, but I did notice a lot of pressure when he tried to undo it.
                    My G-Shock is pretty thick, so that might have made it harder for him.
                    Good execution overall, though.

                    ## Talks and Workshops

                    ## Day One

                    ### Nice to Meet You! That Will Be 20 Million Please

                    The first talk I attended was *Nice to Meet You! That Will Be 20 Million Please* by David Décary-Hétu.
                    It was about how to properly respond to ransomware attacks – essentially a good reminder to stay calm and avoid making rash decisions.

                    ### UNO Reverse Card: Exposing C2 Operators Through Their Own Logs

                    Next, I attended *UNO Reverse Card: Exposing C2 Operators Through Their Own Logs* by Estelle Ruellan.
                    She shared four stories about discovering details about malware operators by infecting them back and watching their activity.
                    It was interesting to see how these operators try to protect themselves and where they slip up.

                    ### Get Off Your High Horse: How Your Expertise Doesn't Matter in an IPV Context

                    I spent the rest of the day with Corinne Pulgar from lab2038 for *Get Off Your High Horse: How Your Expertise Doesn't Matter in an IPV Context*.
                    This was a workshop on managing cyber violence in intimate partner violence (IPV) situations.
                    We role-played realistic scenarios and attempted to virtually resolve problems based on real stories.
                    It was humbling – these situations are tricky, and general recommendations often don't work.
                    In short, there's no one-size-fits-all solution. Each situation is unique and must be handled case by case, with a focus on listening to the victims first.

                    ### Stolen Laptops - A Brief Overview of Modern Physical Access Attacks

                    I also attended *Stolen Laptops - A Brief Overview of Modern Physical Access Attacks* by Pierre-Nicolas Allard-Coutu.
                    This talk covered what can be done with a stolen laptop to access supposedly secure information and even gain access to new accounts.
                    It was a lot of firmware tampering and low-level hacking – a lot of fun to listen to.

                    ## Day Two

                    ### Efficient Web Hacking with Caido

                    Originally, I planned to attend *Reading The Docs: Hardware Hacking* by Jonathan Marcil, but when I got there, the room was packed, and they were using an older badge.
                    Since I already know a bit about embedded systems, I decided it might be too beginner-level for me.
                    Instead, I went to *Efficient Web Hacking with Caido* by Justin Gardner.
                    Caido is a powerful web testing tool with a freemium model. The free version is quite powerful, and the premium is affordable.
                    The workshop covered features like request tampering, automation, and workflows, using a test website to practice.
                    It was really useful, and I plan to use Caido in future challenges.
                    Check it out if you're interested: [Caido](https://caido.rhynorater.com)

                    ### Enhancing Identity Credential Privacy with Zero-Knowledge Proofs

                    I also attended *Enhancing Identity Credential Privacy with Zero-Knowledge Proofs* by Christian Paquin.
                    This was essentially a presentation of Crescent, a new way to prove facts about yourself without revealing additional information.
                    For example, proving you're over 18 without revealing your actual birth date.
                    If you're curious, you can check out the GitHub repo: [Crescent Credentials](https://github.com/microsoft/crescent-credentials).

                    ### How Not to Do ML: Showing the Negative Impact of Improper CVE Feature Selection in a Live Exploit Prediction Model

                    Finally, I went to *How Not to Do ML: Showing the Negative Impact of Improper CVE Feature Selection in a Live Exploit Prediction Model* by François Labrèche.
                    This talk was more of a personal journey through an ML project.
                    The main takeaway was that not all data is good data for an ML model – correlation does not imply causation, and models can easily be misled by poorly chosen features.

                    ## Conclusion

                    So, that was my personal experience at NorthSec 2025.
                    It was a lot of fun, and I plan to go to Hackfest next. I'll probably do something similar for that as well.
                    I hope you enjoyed this entry and that it gave you a bit of insight into the event.
                    I'm still trying to start my YouTube channel, but I haven't quite found my voice yet. I keep making videos and finding them too boring.
                    We'll see if I finally end up posting something.

            <h2>Composition over inheritance 2025-05-14</h2>
            <p>
                So, I learned a bit more about Rust. I thought that traits were just an addition to the usual OOP model, but I was wrong.
                They actually replace inheritance entirely. In other words, there’s no way in Rust to make a class inherit from another.
                This is a pretty bold move, considering that inheritance is one of the four main principles of OOP.
                Composition seems superior on paper, though. I guess I’ll need to get more used to it to decide if it’s really a better approach.
                Maybe I’ll come back to it in a couple of years.

            <h2>What I do these days 2025-05-08</h2>
            <p>
                We live in strange times. When I say that, I mean it politically, but I won't get into that here.

                I've been looking for a job for about four months now. It’s been an eye-opening process, seeing how much the market has changed over the past five years.

                I’m proud of my new bachelor's degree in computer science and my LaTeX resume, by the way. No cutting corners here. 😄
                I’m not just figuring out how to get a job but also where I want to go from this point in my career.

                I love cybersecurity analysis, embedded systems, APIs, and building tools. I’m just too curious to settle on one thing to specialize in. One thing I know for sure, though, is that I deeply value open source.

                Open-source code can have a much larger impact. It can outlive you. It can outlive companies.

                My ideal job would be to wake up in the morning, have my smoothie, check GitHub issues, and spend the day proposing implementations and fixes.

                I’ve done some bug reporting for open-source projects in the past. That was my main form of contribution while working full-time and attending university, but recently, I started helping with translations for Mastodon. I’m focusing on Quebec French, though the system still confuses me a bit.

                I also started contributing to mitmproxy, an interesting tool with a lot of features. I chose it because it’s a relatively small project with good documentation, which made it a great first step into more hands-on contributions. It was also my first experience with PyO3, a Python library that lets you use Rust code in Python. It’s great for performance, but it comes with some challenges. The biggest one I’ve noticed is the mismatch in error handling between the two languages. I still prefer Python’s approach, but that might just be because I’m more familiar with it. It’s frustrating when an exception is raised, but instead of a full traceback, you just get a custom error message with no context.

                I have my eye on other projects, but for now, I’ll keep focusing on this one when I have free time.

                Wishing you all the best. Keep the lines of code flowing!

            <h2>Every programing languages I leaned so far that I can remember 2024-07-17</h2>
            <p>
                It started to code at 11. I was using C. The reason is that I wanted to understand how computrers works. 
                I found a web site to start. It was called "Le site du zero." 
                I realy liked this site and did some free courses in there. This website is now called open classroom.
                I was mostly just doing some text based RPG games. A bunch of if basicaly.
                The second language I can think of was mindstorms by lego. 
                I don't know if it was called like that back then. 
                We used it at high school with a little robot.
                I didn't program for some years after that. 
                I was learning electronic repair in a DEP or profecional study diploma I think it's called in English.
                In that course, I don't remember why but there was a part where we needed to flash PIC microcontrolers.
                I looked at the ASM code by curiousity and without doing anything with it I took the time to understand it.
                During that time I started to be fully on linux so I learned some bash automatiastions that will be reenforced later.
                I worked for a year selling computers. I kinda became the linux expert there. 
                I when to college in electronic computers and network and there, I learned a bunch of differant languages. 
                There was of course C++ on ATMEL microcontrolers and on x86. There was ladder and graphset for automats from Siemens. Old ones. 
                I remember the graphset having a canvas size limitation that made no sense to me.
                I learned there the HTML/CSS/javascript/PHP stack.
                I also had a project using the IOs of a raspberry pie with python. 
                That wasn't in the schools plan but I asked to use something else then C++ cause it was getting old for me.
                I asked the teacher if I could use something else to learn more and he said something like "Yeah. But I won't help."
                
                I will continue that later. I didn't realise how big that would be. :3

            <p>
                I'm looking to start a video game project with one of my friend. 
                I did play with Unity a lot but now I will probably use Godot or maybe pygame or love I'm not sure yet. 
                It depends on what we will come up with. We will start the brainstorms in a month.

            <h2>out of grave (OOG) language project 2024-07-05</h2>
            <p>
                During a university course about developing a programming language, I made my own. I called it out of grave. 
                It's a dedicated (not general) language to make text-based games. I'm still working on it to make it more complete.
                The idea is to make a game that runs like a state machine. So you have one file (OOGE) to describe events and one file (OOG) to connect them.
                It compiles into a Java file, so it can be used by Java machines. It uses the combo SABLECC and object macro. Check it out: <a href="https://github.com/turboOrange/oog">OOG</a>

            <h2>My education is a bunch of detours 2024-07-05</h2>
            <p>
                I come from a tourist town up north. The economy there is centered around tourism. 
                I think it influenced a lot of my perspective on myself at the time.
                I wasn't great at high school, but let's just say I was in a stressful environment.
                I was already doing some C coding since I was around 11 for fun. I was mostly doing simple text adventures.
                I learned everything from a site that is now called Open Classroom but was at the time "le site du zero.".
                So when my science teacher finally made us program one of those Lego robots, I had so much fun. 
                He was trying to slow me down, saying that I had to learn the basics to do other things. 
                I told him I was already familiar tho so I guess he just didn't expect someone that young to have touched programming. 
                I know kids today are exposed to concepts at a young age, but back then, I was really young for that kind of stuff. When I finished high school, I wanted to live in Laval.

                I had to decide what I wanted to do with my life, and since I was already mentally preparing for a cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic scenario, I chose to take a two-year course in electronic repair.
                
                I’m serious. When I made that decision, I thought, “What would be one of the most important skills to have in that scenario?” Looking back, I’m not sure if it was naive or brilliant.
                
                From there, I learned the fundamentals of electronics. It was a really fun experience. After that, I spent a year selling computer parts at an electronics store.
                
                I realized there wasn’t much work in electronic repair because things are harder to fix by design. My curiosity got the better of me, so I went to college, even though I initially thought it was impossible for me.
                
                I did a four-year DEC in electronic computers and networks. It was such a great time. It combined my love for electronics with programming. It was the first time I programmed something relatively big. Everything was in C++ and close to the hardware.
                
                We worked with Atmel chips, CPLDs, Cisco network setups, logic gates, and cool electronic projects. It was pure fun. We even refurbished computers with Linux for students who couldn’t afford to buy them.
                
                After that, I decided to go for a degree in electrical engineering at university. I liked what I learned, but I didn’t finish it. I spent 1.5 years there. Unsure of what to do next, I took a year off from education and worked as a programmer.
                
                I decided to keep my job and switched to studying computer science at university. My favorite courses have been in cybersecurity, user interface architecture, and creating your own language.
                
                So here I am, with three courses left until I get my diploma and already five years of experience. I can’t wait. If you ask me what I want to specialize in now, I’m not sure.
                
                For now, I see cybersecurity as a hobby. I’m really into becoming a UX expert and ensuring interfaces are as functional as possible. I also love embedded systems. We’ll see what the future brings!

            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p> 
                I'm a really curious person. Maybe too much, I don't know. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
                During my childhood I was taking things apart to see how things work. When I was 11 I decided that it was the family computer that I would open. My mom hated it but just told me not to unplug things.
                The reason is that I looked online and found a course from Le Site du Zéro to understand how computers work. After looking at the RAM and the hard drive for the first time, I wanted to understand how the software works.
                So on the same site I found a course about C and I started to learn it. I was using Code::Blocks. To be honest, the concept of a function was really hard for me for some reason. I think it's because of the weirdness of C.
                You see, you don't really need .h files or even headers if the functions are on top of the calls. It's a dumb way to go but I was doing it. You can even define functions in the .h files if you want. It works. I don't recommend.

                I didn't think I would be good at designing things so after high school I decided to go for electronic repair. Yes, I know how to repair an old tube TV and other things. (⌐■_■) 
                Then I realized there weren't a lot of jobs for that anymore since electronics became hard to repair, so I decided to just go with the dream, for what I started learning at the beginning. 
                Software development or more firmware, since I was going more for an embedded profile to go with my electronics knowledge.
                I then decided to just learn a bit of every abstraction level to have a personal good understanding of tech in general. That's why I'm into DevOps. It's like yet another layer to explore. It's one that is really company-focused though.
                There are not a lot of DevOps personal projects we can do.

                I did a lot of projects over the years but it's just in the last years that I started to put them on GitHub. I'm looking for the external drive with my old projects at the moment of writing this.

                I didn't use React or Vue or anything to create this site. While I know how to do modern development, I like to work raw on files. It might be nostalgia. I used to create sites on an Apache server for fun.
                You're welcome to check this site around. I hid some things here and there for fun.
